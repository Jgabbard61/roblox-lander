    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the verification data?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is VerifyLens compliant with legal industry requirements?",
      answer: "Yes, VerifyLens is built specifically for legal professionals. We maintain SOC 2 compliance, provide audit trails, ensure attorney-client privilege protection, and follow all data handling requirements for the legal industry."
