## üìã Next Steps - Configuration Required

### STEP 1: Add Your Hero Video

**Location:** `/public/hero-video.mp4`

**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare Your Video:**
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec for best browser support)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - File size: Under 10MB for fast loading
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
   - No audio track needed (will be muted)

2. **Upload Video:**
   - Place your video file in the `/public` folder
   - Name it `hero-video.mp4` (or update the filename in code)
   
3. **Optional: Add Poster Image:**
   - Create a poster image (first frame of video)
   - Save as `/public/hero-poster.jpg`
   - This displays while video loads

4. **Activate Video in Code:**
   - Open: `components/hero-section.tsx`
   - Find the commented `<video>` element (around line 40)
   - Uncomment the entire `<video>` block
   - Remove or comment out the gradient placeholder div (line 55)

**Example video element (already in code, just uncomment):**
```jsx
<video
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted
  playsInline
  poster="/hero-poster.jpg"
  className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover z-0"
>
  <source src="/hero-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="/hero-video.webm" type="video/webm" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

**Pro Tips:**
- For better performance, host video on CDN (AWS S3, Cloudflare)
- Create WebM version for better browser compatibility
- Test on mobile devices to ensure smooth playback

   - Find line 426 (the `data-url` attribute)
   - Replace:
